   <p>Economic mobility is defined as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_mobility" target="_blank">"the ability of an individual, family or some other group 
     to improve (or lower) their economic status—usually measured in income"</a> and is a key factor in the creation of a vibrant society and a healthy economy. It is also a globally universal issue, which most countries are
     far from solving - some who even exacerbate the problem. This project aims to investigate whether the United States falls into that category of countries which
     discourage economic mobility, primarily focusing on wealth, housing, and education.</p>

	<p>As defined, economic mobility is often measured in terms of income and wealth, which we should see an upwards trend of in an individual’s lifetime should economic mobility be achieved. 
		As demonstrated by the two below graphs, this is not the case. We can draw from these that the share of the total net worth held by the top 1% has rarely dipped over the last 30 
		years and, in general, has been increasing steadily. Compared to this, the net worth held by the bottom 50% has been volatile, facing a substantial downfall after 2007 - the year
		of the Financial Crisis.</p>

	<h2 class="bodyText"><span style="color: rgb(65, 48, 34); font-weight: 700;">The Beginning: Residential Housing</span></h2>
	<p>A well-versed argument surrounding economic mobility is the idea that it first stems from an individual’s background - their upbringing,
		also seen as the home and state in which they are born. After observing the House Price Index, it is clear that states are respectively 
		affected by usual house market fluctuations. However, since 1980, New York has seen a significant rise in residential house pricing 
		and currently is over 2.5 times higher than that of Mississippi. Such significant differences between states, as further evidenced 
		by the map chart, would prevent movements of economic mobility. This deepens the belief that an individual may be economically immobile 
		from the outset.

	<h2 class="bodyText"><span style="color: rgb(65, 48, 34); font-weight: 700;">The Quintessential Driver of Economic Mobility: Education</span></h2>
	<p>With that, I sought to see if these state differences in house prices correlated with the standard of education in those areas. 
Many Americans believe in a progressive tax system, where the rich pay a larger share of their income than the poor: <a href="https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/party-platform/" target="_blank">"Democrats 
		will reform the tax code to be more progressive and equitable".</a> This would result in more (and equal) funding for education countrywide, driving economic mobility.
	</p>
	<p>However, when looking at the charts below, it is evident that it is the contrary. 4 of out 10 people living in Massachusetts have a Bachelor's 
	degree or higher. This is twice the amount of people for those in West Virginia. When we refer back to the map, West Virginia is also the state with 
	the lowest house prices, insinuating poorer neighborhoods.
	</p>
	<p>Why is this the case? In America, school funding is based on the real estate taxes of the houses within that school district. The higher the house 
		prices are (representing more expensive neighborhoods), the more funding goes to the school, producing higher-quality education. Inversely, 
		poorer neighborhoods pool less funding for schools in their area, relating to the concept that the level of economic mobility is determined by 
		where your home is. The second chart below further supports this positive causal relationship between median house prices and state education funding.

	<h2 class="bodyText"><span style="color: rgb(65, 48, 34); font-weight: 700;">The Conclusion</span></h2>
	<p>With the current regressive tax system held in place, the US is systematically powering the rich and 
		forbidding the poor from moving up the economic ladder. By selectively enabling the same states 
		to consistently have access to higher real estate assets, greater community funds, and better schools,
		the US is - and will continue to - disenable its citizens of economic mobility, provoking severe 
		implications for the economy in the future. 
	</p>
	<p>While most of the factors illustrated above provide apparent correlations to economic mobility, there is 
		not adequate evidence to conclude direct causality. However, the research provided some beneficial 
		insight and a motivation for assessing potential policy reformations on the subject.
